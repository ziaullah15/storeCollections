    "description": "The line “all I ever wanted was my name on fire” came about  due to me hearing something wrong  on the record ‘Nuttin’ But Flavor’ - I thought Charlie Brown was saying fire but he was actually saying flyers. Anyway ‘name on  fire’ always resonated with me and I felt it was well suited to graffiti culture. Happy accident let’s say.Nuttin’But Flavour is a hip hop track with Biz Markie, Charlie Brown, Ol Dirty Bastard and Funk master Flex released in 1995. Physical t-shirt is available exclusively to the primary purchasers. Holders can view and interact with the collectible in 3D & Augmented Reality.",
